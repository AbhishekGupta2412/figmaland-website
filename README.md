Figma Land Website
This project is a complete, responsive landing page for "Figma Land," built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It was created as a front-end development assignment, focusing on pixel-perfect design, dynamic functionality, and adherence to modern web standards.

Features Implemented
The website includes a variety of dynamic and interactive features as per the project requirements:

Interactive Video Player: The promotional video section includes a custom play/pause button. The "Play" icon is shown when the video is paused and hidden during playback.

Automatic Testimonial Carousel:

The "Testimonial" section is a fully functional slider/carousel.

Testimonials automatically slide to the next one every 5 seconds.

Users can also navigate through testimonials by clicking on the dots, which update to show the currently active slide.

Contact Form with Modal:

The contact form includes basic HTML validation for required fields like email.

Upon clicking the "Send" button, a success modal appears with the message: "Your query sent successfully."

The modal includes a close button, and the page background is not scrollable while the modal is open.

Embedded Google Maps: The "Contact Us" section features an interactive map integrated using the Google Maps embed feature.

Mobile Responsiveness: The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring it doesn't break on different desktop viewports or mobile devices.

Technologies Used
This project was built from scratch, adhering to the constraint of not using any major CSS or JavaScript frameworks.

HTML5: The structure is built with modern, semantic HTML5 tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer>.

CSS3: All styling, including the layout, animations, and responsive design, is done with custom CSS. It utilizes modern features like Flexbox, Grid, and custom variables.

Vanilla JavaScript: All interactive functionalities, such as the video player, testimonial slider, and contact form modal, are powered by plain JavaScript without any external libraries.
